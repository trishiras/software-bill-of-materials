# software-bill-of-materials


## Overview
A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generator tool provides a detailed inventory of all components, 
libraries, and dependencies used in a software project. It identifies each componentâ€™s version, license, 
and origin, offering transparency and traceability for both open-source and proprietary software. 
The tool automates the creation of SBOMs, ensuring accurate, up-to-date records that help organizations 
manage security vulnerabilities, compliance with licensing terms, and supply chain risks. 
This allows developers, security teams, and auditors to assess the integrity and safety of 
software efficiently, improving overall governance and reducing the risk of security breaches.
